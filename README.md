# FashionMNISTExplorer

FashionMNISTExplorer is a project focused on exploring and classifying images of clothing items using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The goal is to create a neural network model to classify these images accurately.

## Introduction
FashionMNISTExplorer is designed to provide insights into the Fashion MNIST dataset and demonstrate various machine learning techniques for image classification. The project uses TensorFlow/Keras to build, train, and evaluate neural network models.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

Each image is 28x28 pixels, and there are 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FashionMNISTExplorer.git
